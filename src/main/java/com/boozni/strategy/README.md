### Example Scenario:

The Strategy Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms or behaviors, encapsulate each one as a separate class, and make them interchangeable. This pattern promotes flexibility by allowing the behavior of an object to be changed at runtime without modifying the object itself.

**Key Features:**
-  The Strategy Pattern enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
-  It defines a set of strategies (algorithms) that can be used interchangeably.
-  The client can switch between these strategies dynamically, depending on the needs.

**Components:**
1. **Context**: This class holds a reference to a strategy object and interacts with it.
1. **Strategy**: The common interface that all concrete strategies must implement. It defines the method that will be executed by the context.
1. **Concrete** Strategies: These classes implement the Strategy interface, each providing its own version of the algorithm.

#### Example Scenario:
Imagine a payment processing system. Depending on the type of payment (credit card, PayPal, or cryptocurrency), you need different algorithms to process the payment. Instead of hardcoding the payment processing logic, you can use the Strategy pattern to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime.
